          We envision a future where workplace confusion is replaced by clarity
          — where every team member knows what to do, who they’re working with,
          and what’s expected of them. TeamBase aims to become the preferred
          solution for team structure and collaboration, particularly for agile
          teams and remote-first companies around the world
