          Our mission is to build a centralized platform that empowers teams of
          all sizes to collaborate effectively, define roles clearly, and manage
          responsibilities with ease. We believe that every team deserves tools
          that are simple, reliable, and enjoyable to use â€” so they can focus
          more on the work that matters.
